## Overview

This project is a web application that utilizes the Rick and Morty API to display information about the characters, episodes, and locations from the animated TV show "Rick and Morty." The application is built using TypeScript for the logic, HTML for the structure, and CSS for the styling. The goal of the project was to create an entertaining and informative wiki to explore details about the show.

## Features

- **Episode Guide:** Users can also explore a list of episodes, providing details like episode name, air date, and a list of characters that appeared in that episode.

- **Character Information:** The application allows users to browse through a list of characters from the show. Each character card displays essential information such as name, species, status, and origin.

- **Location Insights:** The application provides a collection of locations featured in the show. Users can see the name, type, and residents of each location.

## Installation

Before running the project, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. To install the required dependencies, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install bootstrap
npm install @types/bootstrap
```

## Knowledge Implementation

### TypeScript

The core logic of the application is implemented in TypeScript. It revolves around fetching data from the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com) using the fetch API and then rendering this data on the web page.

### HTML

The HTML structure of the application is designed to provide an empty template for the TypeScript functions to work on. It consists of different sections for characters, episodes, and locations. Each section is dynamically populated with the relevant data fetched from the API.

### CSS and Bootstrap

The styling of the application is achieved using Bootstrap. In order to achieve a more customized look a CSS file was used aswell. The project incorporates responsive design principles to ensure the application looks and functions well on different screen sizes thanks. 

### Challenges Faced

This project was both entertaining and challenging to work on. While integrating the TypeScript, HTML, and CSS components together, I encountered several hurdles. One of the notable challenges was ensuring smooth asynchronous data fetching and handling. Additionally, aligning the Bootstrap styles with the overall design of the application required careful consideration and fine-tuning.

## Conclusion

I have found this project to be both tough and exciting because it allowed me to put in practice everything I learned so far. This journey showcased the dynamic nature of web development and highlighted the importance of perseverance in overcoming obstacles.

As I look ahead, this project encourages me to delve deeper into the world of application development and continuously refine my skills. The lessons learned and the satisfaction gained from this endeavor will undoubtedly fuel my enthusiasm for future projects and endeavors.
